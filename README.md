## Prophet Challenge
--------------------

### Overview
------------

The Prophet Challenge is a project that aims to analyze and forecast patterns in hourly search data for MercadoLibre, a popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The project uses the Prophet library to create a time series model that predicts the popularity of MercadoLibre based on historical search data.

### Project Goals
----------------

The primary goal of the Prophet Challenge is to:

* Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic for MercadoLibre.
* Mine the search traffic data for predictable seasonal patterns of interest in the company.
* Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.
* Create a time series model with Prophet to forecast the popularity of MercadoLibre.

### Methodology
--------------

The project follows a step-by-step approach:

1. **Data Collection**: The project collects hourly search data for MercadoLibre from 2016 to 2020.
2. **Data Analysis**: The project analyzes the search data to identify unusual patterns and seasonal trends.
3. **Data Modeling**: The project creates a time series model using Prophet to forecast the popularity of MercadoLibre.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The project evaluates the performance of the model and identifies areas for improvement.

### Key Findings
----------------

The project reveals several key findings:

1. **Unusual Patterns**: The search data exhibits unusual patterns, including a surge in search traffic during the winter holiday period.
2. **Seasonal Trends**: The search data exhibits seasonal trends, including a peak in search traffic during the evening hours and a dip during the morning hours.
3. **Stock Price Patterns**: The search traffic is related to stock price patterns, with a positive correlation between search traffic and stock price returns.
4. **Forecasting**: The Prophet model forecasts a near-term increase in search traffic, with a peak in popularity during the evening hours.

### Conclusion
----------

The Prophet Challenge demonstrates the effectiveness of using time series modeling to forecast patterns in search data. The project provides valuable insights into the behavior of MercadoLibre's search traffic and its relationship to stock price patterns. The findings of this project can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve the overall performance of MercadoLibre.
